# Quiz-java
This is a simple quiz project, developed using JavaFx and mysql. 
I've used JavaFx to develop the frontend of the application, in which the user is asked 10 questions of variable difficulty level which
are stored in the backend MySql. Before starting the quiz the user has to put his name and roll number which is stored in the leaderboard
alongwith the time it took the user to complete the quiz and his score. Both leaderboard and questions are maintained in MySql. Even if user quits in between his score is saved. The user can also bookmark any question
and comeback to it later or can jump to any question. He is shown a progress bar for the questions he has attempted and a 120 second timer after which the quiz will automatically stop.
